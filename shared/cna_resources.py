"""Locate the reference resources that the Verdict module needs.

Verdict (ClairS-TO's Python port of ASCAT) needs, for the assembly the input BAM was aligned
to, a set of common germline SNP sites (one loci file and one allele file per contig), the GC
content around those sites and, optionally, their replication timing. A resource directory
has this layout::

    <cna_resource_dir>/
        loci_files/<loci prefix>chr1.txt ... <loci prefix>chrX.txt
        allele_files/<alleles prefix>chr1.txt ... <alleles prefix>chrX.txt
        GC_<name>.txt
        RT_<name>.txt            (optional; LogR is corrected for GC content only when absent)

The file name prefixes are discovered from the directory, so a resource set built for another
assembly (for example T2T-CHM13) can carry names that say so. Exactly one candidate is allowed
for each item; when several match, the directory holds more than one resource set and the
caller is told instead of one being picked silently. The GRCh38 set shipped with ClairS-TO
(``G1000_loci_hg38_chr*.txt``, ``G1000_alleles_hg38_chr*.txt``, ``GC_G1000_hg38.txt``,
``RT_G1000_hg38.txt``) resolves to exactly the paths ClairS-TO used before this module existed.
